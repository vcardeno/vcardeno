Hi all, I'm Victor. I currently work as a data analyst for Chase in Phoenix, AZ. This GitHub is just to document different side projects I'm working on in my spare time on different subjects that are interesting to me as I strive to improve my data science skills and also explore some intriguing topics at the same time. I'm by no means an expert on specific topics or languages; I'm mostly using these side projects to actually maintain skills and languages I learned in school and learn new ones. If you're reading this, I hope you find something interesting here; please reach out with any questions :)
